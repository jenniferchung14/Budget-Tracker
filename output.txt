#CASE 9 - Entering something random when asking if we have a budget goal and when it asks if we want to enter another entry
Welcome!! This program is meant to help keep you keep track of your purchases and the how much you are are spending.
You can use this program at the end of the month to see how you did with your budget goal and what the total amount
of money you have spent on all your purchases are or even at the end of a week or day.
With this program you can keep yourself a little more organized with your financial side, where you are able to
see all your purchases in one list instead of flipping through multiple receipts and statements and pulling out a
calculator to do calculations.
You will be prompted to ask answer multiple questions regarding your purchases which will then allow all the purchases
you entered to be displayed as a list in the end, as well as the total you spent and how you did regarding keep up with
your budget goal if you had one.
